    <h2>Tea</h2>
    <p>
      Tea is an aromatic beverage prepared by pouring hot or boiling water over
      cured or fresh leaves of Camellia sinensis, an evergreen shrub native to
      East Asia which probably originated in the borderlands of southwestern
      China and northern Myanmar. Tea is also rarely made from the leaves of
      Camellia taliensis.
